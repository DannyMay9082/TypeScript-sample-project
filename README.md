    <br>
    <br>
    Base project made with much :heart:. Contains CRUD, advanced patterns, generated library, and much more!
    I'm rebuilding the project to add some new cool features like GraphQL. Also, I've been a father a few days ago so please be patient if something doesn't work properly, and feel free to contribute to the project. I will accept MR if they make sense.
