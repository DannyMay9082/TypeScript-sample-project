    <br>
    <br>
    Base project made with much :heart:. Contains CRUD, advanced patterns, generated library, and much more!
    I'm rebuilding the project to add some new cool features like GraphQL. Also, I've been a father a few days ago so please be patient if something doesn't work properly, and feel free to contribute to the project. I will accept MR if they make sense.

### Angular Universal and i18n

This project is using Angular Universal with the official internationalization. You can navigate
through every language and reload (and share) every page in the application without losing context.
This is very useful for SEO purposes and you almost have a ready for production app. If you want to
translate the messages you can use this awesome tool,
[Tiny Translator](https://martinroob.github.io/tiny-translator/en/#/translate) or follow
[this tutorial](https://github.com/martinroob/ngx-i18nsupport/wiki/Tutorial-for-using-xliffmerge-with-angular-cli).

I've created a medium post where you can find a tutorial to apply this concepts to your own project.
[Check it here](https://medium.com/@ismaestro/angular-7-example-app-with-angularcli-angular-universal-i18n-official-firebase-66deac2dc31e),
and let me know what do you think.
